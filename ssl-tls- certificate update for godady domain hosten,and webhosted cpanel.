Solus.ie SSL/TLC certificate update:

There are a few steps that are important at the time of SSL/TLS certificate renewal of Solus.ie.

Step#1
 Devs/client give us .cert-file, ca-bundle, and a private key file,  private-key which extension is filename.pfx.


We will take this file and open in any Linux server with below mentioned command which generates a private key from this file.

On executing the below command it will ask  password given by dev’s/client,  in this case password is:   MagentoRolus21

# openssl pkcs12 -in magento.pfx -nocerts -out privatekey.pem -nodes



# ls -l   =   it will show private-key.pem file,  

# Go to cpanel —->  manage ssl certificates   click on domain which is showing certificate is expired , click update —> give domain name—>  paste .cert file ,   —-> paste private key , and click on auto fill,     if key is invalid there should be popup invalid indicator will sow, you should have to update valid key.

Now you can verify website url in browser if it is going with ssl or not.

Additional steps::

In case of key invalid you can verify privatekey format, certificate format  key is valid or not by executing below command:


# openssl rsa -in privatekey.pem -check

To verify the certificate validity:

# openssl x509 -in certificate.pem -text -noout

Match the Private key and certificate they are associated with each other or not.

Fist we will generate public key from private key to match it with certificate

# openssl rsa -in privatekey.pem -pubout -outform pem -out pubkey.pem

Now we will compare the public key with the certificate.pem in case of any ambiguity or mismatch by executing the below command. 

I

# openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in certificate.pem | openssl rsa -pubin -outform pem | diff - pubkey.pem


If key or cert is invalid it will thow error, if it is accurate it will throw no error.
